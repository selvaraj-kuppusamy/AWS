Type the user name for the new user. This is the sign-in name for AWS. If you want to add multiple users, choose Add another user for each additional user and type their user names. You can add up to 10 users at one time.

Select the type of access this set of users will have. You can select programmatic access, access to the AWS Management Console, or both. 

- Select Programmatic access if the users require access to the API, AWS CLI, or Tools for Windows PowerShell. This creates an access key for each new user. You can view or download the access keys when you get to the Final page.

- Select AWS Management Console access if the users require access to the AWS Management Console. This creates a password for each new user.
* For Console password, choose one of the following:
  - Autogenerated password. Each user gets a randomly generated password that meets the account password policy. You can view or download the passwords when you get to the Final page.

  - Custom password. Each user is assigned the password that you type in the box.
- (Optional) We recommend that you select Require password reset to ensure that users are forced to change their password the first time they sign in.

Choose Next: Permissions.

On the Set permissions page, specify how you want to assign permissions to this set of new users. Choose one of the following three options:

- Add user to group
- Copy permissions from existing user
- Attach existing policies directly

  In My case I Choose Attach existing policies directly and the I Select AmazonEC2FullAccess policies.

Choose Next: Tags.
